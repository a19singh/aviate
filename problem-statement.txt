Following is the Assignment:

What to do?
———————-
Build REST API server for basic ATS for recruiters.
- It should have api endpoints to create, search, shortlist or reject candidates. (done)
- It should be able to store the candidate's name, age, gender, years_of_exp, phone number, email, current salary and expected salary. Apart from this there will be a status field, which will be “Applied” by default and it will change if the candidate gets shortlisted or rejected. (done)
- Search api should be a listing api, which can be used to filter/search for specific candidates, who satisfy all the applied conditions. Example of search conditions: (done)
- Search for all candidates whose expected salary is between 8 to 12. (done)
- Search for candidates whose age is between 21 to 30 and years of exp is more than 3. (done)
- Search for candidate based of there phone number, email or name. (done)

You can use any python based web framework, preferably Django Rest Framework.

Bonus Point
———————
- Create a separate api for name based search, which has a relevance based sorting. So that given a query, the api should return results in the following order:
- On Top, Should be exact matches, where the query matches the name exactly.
- After that should be all the names where some of the words in the query match the words in the name, in the descending order of number of overlapping words.
- Example: if a query is “Ajay Kumar yadav” the order of results will be [“Ajay Kumar Yadav”, “Ajay Kumar”, “Ajay Yadav”, “Kumar Yadav”, “Ramesh Yadav”, “Ajay Singh”]
- Write as optimised version of this logic as you can possibly think of.

How to submit?
